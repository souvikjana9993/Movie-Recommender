# AI Movie Recommender - Docker Compose Configuration
# 
# This file sets up the movie recommender service with:
# - Automatic restart on failure
# - Data persistence across container restarts
# - Health checks
# - Environment configuration via .env file
#
# Setup Instructions:
#   1. Copy .env.example to .env and add your API keys
#   2. Run: docker-compose up -d
#   3. Wait 60-90 seconds for first boot (generates embeddings)
#   4. Access at http://localhost:8097
#
# Your data is stored in ./data/ and persists across restarts:
#   - watch_history.json: Your Jellyfin watch history
#   - embeddings.pkl: Neural embeddings (expensive to regenerate!)
#   - recommendations.json: Calculated recommendations
#   - all_scores.json: Pre-calculated scores
#   - disliked_items.json: Hidden movies (4-month expiration)
